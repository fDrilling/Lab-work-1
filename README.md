# Lab-work-1
This is my first relatively large (300 lines) code and I hope it will be good enough to get me started.

In this programming lab assignment I had to create an algorithm to convert a nucleoside XYZ file into a PDB file. The algorithm determines the chemical index of each atom in the nucleoside and writes it into the PDB file in the proper format for any PDB reader to process it correctly.

# So this is the example of xyz file being transformed:

# This PDB is the result of the file transformation by my algorithm:

# Usage of this algorithm
The algorithm itself consists of a single file, main.py or main.ipynb (choose one).
